# Perfect number: Perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors.
# The smallest perfect number is 6, which is the sum of 1, 2, and 3.
# Some other perfect numbers are 28(1+2+4+7+14=28), 496 and 8128.
# Write a function that finds perfect numbers between 1 and 1000. Check perfect numbers between 1 and 1000 and find the sum of the perfect numbers using reduce and filter functions.
