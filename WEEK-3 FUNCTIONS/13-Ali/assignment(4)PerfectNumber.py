# ## 4-perfect_number.py
# Perfect number: Perfect number is a positive
# integer that is equal to the sum of its 
# proper divisors.
# The smallest perfect number is 6, which is
# the sum of 1, 2, and 3.
# Some other perfect numbers are 28(1+2+4+7+14=28),
# 496 and 8128.
# Write a function that finds perfect numbers
# between 1 and 1000. Check perfect numbers
# between 1 and 1000 and find the sum of the
# perfect numbers using reduce and filter 
# functions.
